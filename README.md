# Simon-Says_Game
This mini project is based on basic learning of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
# Description
With the help of basic knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript I tried to create a well known game called Simon Says. 
This is a typical brain game which checks your memorising ability.
The object of the game is to mimic Simon's(computer) moves.
Each time you correctly match the flashes, the level goes up.
If yu click out of the order or sequence, your game is over and you have to restart the game from level 1.
